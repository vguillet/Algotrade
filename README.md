"Econophysics is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods originally developed by physicists
in order to solve problems in economics, usually those including uncertainty or stochastic processes
and nonlinear dynamics. Some of its application to the study of financial markets has also been termed
statistical finance referring to its roots in statistical physics."

This folder contains the various scripts and codes created for the algorithmics trading 
project of group 21. It is structured as follows:

The PhyTrade folder contains all the scripts required for performing the technical
analysis, along with the tools required to collect the technnical data and combine
splines/signals

The Twitter analysis folder contains all the scripts required to scrape the web for
tweets, along with the sentiment analysis. The tweets collected are also stored there.

The Prototype 1 scripts contains all the code required for the technical analysis
process along with the formating and weigthed adittion of the two analysis.

To run the main program, run dev menu, which calls on the tradebot_1 script which initialise
an analysis and performs the buy and trades acitons based on it.

The report along with all documentation is conatained in the Project_resources folder
