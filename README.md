"Econophysics is an interdisciplinary research field, applying theories and methods originally developed by physicists
in order to solve problems in economics, usually those including uncertainty or stochastic processes
and nonlinear dynamics. Some of its application to the study of financial markets has also been termed
statistical finance referring to its roots in statistical physics."
